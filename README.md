# Extended Kalman Filter 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive) 

Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project a Kalman filter is utilized to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. 

This project involves the Udacity Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO, this is what I actually used and tested. Having Ubuntu subsystem inside Windows 10 is very powerful.

## Build and Install

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF


Here is the main protocol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


**INPUT**: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


**OUTPUT**: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x

["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y

["rmse_x"]

["rmse_y"]

["rmse_vx"]

["rmse_vy"]

## Other Important Dependencies

These dependencies will be installed if you use the provided setup files.

* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)


## Project Notes

The project provides a CMakeFile that should work regardless of the changes you make; the project must be buildable using cmake and make!

## Result

The Kalman Filter was able to track the car using the provided noisy LASER and RADAR data.
